alder <- read_sf("data/Aldermanic_Districts.shp") %>% 
  st_make_valid() %>% #source polygons contained some invalid geometries
  mutate(area_ald = st_area(.)) #calculate area for later use
```

As a first step, we'll just do a spatial join of the zoning districts with the aldermanic districts:

```{r}
zon_alder <- zoning %>% 
  st_join(alder, st_intersects)

```

Aldermanic district boundaries and zoning district boundaries don't always line up, and a zoning district can be in multiple aldermanic districts. The `get_dupes` function from the `janitor` package can easily identify those:

```{r}
dupes <- zon_alder %>% 
  get_dupes(OBJECTID.x) %>% 
  arrange(desc(dupe_count))

```

We can see that there are zoning districts that are in as many as `r max(dupes$dupe_count)` aldermanic district, and this some of these districts are large (zoning districts are red; the outlines of the aldermanic districts white):

```{r}


tmap_mode("view")


tm_shape(dupes) +
  tm_polygons(col = "red") +
    tm_shape(alder) +
  #tm_polygons(alpha = .2,) +
  tm_borders("white", lwd = .5) +
    tm_layout(title = "Zoning districts covering multiple aldermanic districts")
  
```

So before we can calculate percentages of zoning types per district, we need to stamp out the duplicate zoning districts out of their respective aldermanic district. This can be done with the `st_intersection` function. A good reminder of the types of geometric operations can be found in "Geocomputation with R"[@lovelace2019j]:

![Spatial equivalents of logical operators. Figure 5.8 in "Geocomputation with R"](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/05-geometry-operations_files/figure-html/venn-clip-1.png)

Let's run this on `dupes`:

```{r}
de_dupe <- dupes %>% 
  st_intersection(alder) %>% 
  distinct(ALD_DIST.1, .keep_all = T) %>% #drop duplicate rows
  select(-Zoning_Doc, Zoning_Dis, ShapeSTAre, ShapeSTLen, ALD_DIST)
```

When trying to visualize the result, we get an error:
```{r}
de_dupe %>% 
  #filter(OBJECTID.x == 400534) %>% 
  tm_shape() +
  tm_fill("ALD_DIST.1",
          alpha = .4)
```
Looking at the error in row 84 shows this:

```{r}
de_dupe$geometry[84,]
```
It's a linestring, not a polygon! What has happened here that there was enough overlap between the geometries to be caught by `st_intersection` but the overlap is such a small sliver that it essentially becomes a line.

```{r}
de_dupe[-84,] %>% 
  tm_shape() +
  tm_fill("ALD_DIST.1",
          alpha = .4)
```

Merely removing the offending line doesn't fix the issue---probably there are many instance of this happening:

```{r echo=T}
st_geometry_type(de_dupe)
```
Quite the potpourri of geometry types! We could filter by geometry type, but it's difficult to figure out which ones to keep and which ones to drop. For example, row 226 is a polygon, but when you plot it, it turns out not to be that useful:

```{r}
de_dupe[226,] %>% 
  mapview()
```

I considered different approaches to fixing this (e.g. filtering out geometries with very small areas) but none of them really worked. Fortunately we don't have to be able to map the districts in order to do the quantitative analysis. So I'll will intersect all zoning districts with aldermanic districts now and then calculate their area (in m^2):

```{r}
zon_alder_split <- zon_alder %>% 
  st_intersection(alder) %>% 
  distinct(ALD_DIST.1, .keep_all = T) %>% #drop duplicate rows
  select(-c(Zoning_Doc, Zoning_Dis, ShapeSTAre, ShapeSTLen, ALD_DIST))

zon_alder_split <- zon_alder_split %>% 
  mutate(area_zon = st_area(.))

```
Now we could summarize the proportions of different types of zoning by aldermanic district:

```{r}
zon_alder_split %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(ALD_DIST.1, ZONING_COD) %>% 
  summarize(share_of_land = sum(area_zon)/area_ald.1) %>% 
  distinct()
```
Of course this too granular and we need to aggregate types of zoning districts. I did some of this work for a [previous post](https://haraldkliems.netlify.app/posts/how-much-of-madison-allows-only-detached-single-family-housing/). Of note, the denominator of the area requires some decisions. It makes sense not to include parks, airports, or the UW campus. These will be excluded before calculating the single-family residential ratio.



```{r}

#create variables for residential zoning and single-family zoning codes
res_zones <- c("SR-C1", 
                 "SR-C2", 
                 "SR-C3", 
                 "SR-V1",
                 "SR-V2",
                 "TR-C1",
                 "TR-C2", 
                 "TR-C3",
                 "TR-C4",
                 "TR-V1",
                 "TR-V2", 
                 "TR-U1", 
                 "TR-U2", 
                 "TR-R",
                 "TR-P")

sfr_zones <- c("SR-C1", 
         "SR-C2",
         "TR-C1", 
         "TR-C2", 
         "TR-C3", 
         "TR-R")

# someone was interested what the analysis would look 
# like if instead of looking at only residential, you 
# would look at all land, except for parks, airports etc. New variable
# for all "Special Districts"
other <- c("A",
           "UA",
           "CN",
           "PR",
           "AP",
           "CI",
           "PD",
           "PHMP")



  

zon_pct <- zon_alder_split %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  filter(!ZONING_COD %in% other) %>% #remove non-developable land
  mutate(sfr = case_when(ZONING_COD %in% sfr_zones ~ "sfr",
                         T ~ "other")) %>% #dichotomize remaining zoning codes
  group_by(ALD_DIST.1, sfr) %>% 
  summarize(area_dist = sum(area_zon)) %>% #sum up area by district and zoning
  pivot_wider(names_from = sfr, values_from = area_dist) %>%
  mutate(sfr = replace_na(sfr, 0)) %>% #districts with no sfr show up as NA; replace with 0
  mutate(pct_residential = as.numeric(sfr / (other + sfr))) #calculate ratio
  
```
Now we can create a choropleth map of the percentages:

```{r}
alder %>% 
  select(-OBJECTID) %>% 
  left_join(zon_pct, by = c("ALD_DIST" = "ALD_DIST.1")) %>% 
  tm_shape() +
  tm_polygons("pct_residential", style = "jenks",
              palette = "viridis")
```

```{r}


#calculate total residential area
res_total <- data %>%
  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% res_zones) %>%
  summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))

#detached single-family only
res_sfr <- data %>%
  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% sfr_zones) %>%
  summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))

# only special district area
other_area <- data %>%
  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% other) %>%
  summarise(sum(ShapeSTArea))

total <- data %>% summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))
res_sfr/(total-other_area)
sfr_ratio <- round((res_sfr/res_total)*100, digits = 0)

# relationship between % single family zoning and overall density
dens_zon <- read_csv("data/density_zoning.csv")

dens_zon %>% 
  spread(Measure, Value) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sfr, density, label = City)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, angle = 45, vjust = 0.1, hjust = -0.1)

```
